**The intelligent, automated media manager for your adult content collection.**

Eros takes the chaos out of managing a large library. It automates the entire lifecycle of your content—from discovering new scenes from your favorite performers to downloading them with intelligent quality matching and organizing them with rich metadata.

## Why Eros?

Managing a local collection is often a manual, messy process. You have to check multiple sites for updates, manually search for torrents, rename files, and scrape metadata.

**Eros solves this by:**
- **Automating Discovery**: Automatically finding new content based on your subscriptions.
- **Ensuring Quality**: downloading the best version available based on your custom profiles.
- **Organizing Everything**: Keeping your library clean with consistent naming and rich metadata.

## Key Features

- **🎯 Smart Subscriptions**: Subscribe to **Performers**, **Studios**, or track specific **Scenes**. Eros monitors for new releases automatically.
- **🔌 Modular Architecture**: Built to be extensible.
  - **Metadata Providers**: Currently supports **StashDB** with a flexible plugin system for future providers.
  - **Download Clients**: Integrated with **qBittorrent**, with a design ready for other clients (Transmission, Deluge, etc.).
  - **Indexers**: Seamless integration with **Prowlarr** to access hundreds of trackers.
- **🧠 Intelligent Matching**: Uses advanced cross-encoder AI models to ensure the content found matches exactly what you're looking for—no more false positives.
- **⚡ Quality Profiles**: Define your preferred resolutions and formats (e.g., "2160p Preference", "1080p Only").
- **📁 Automated Organization**: Moves and renames files automatically, generating `.nfo` and downloading posters for compatibility with media servers like Plex/Jellyfin.
